Brand Sentiment Analysis using Twitter Mentions

Abstract:
This project tries to analyse tweets generated using a Twitter API.  We extract the tweets from Twitter and classify each tweet into a "positive" or "negative" sentiment. In this project in particular, we look at tweets related to specific models
of cars. We are using a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict the sentiment for our dataset. 
This way, companies can get a general idea of whether the attitude towards the product is good or bad upon which they can act accordingly. 
It should be mentioned that the timing of such analysis is relevant to the discussion. For example, running such a model when a new product releases is the best way to use or implement this idea.

Modules Included:
1) Tweets are fetched based on input parameters and stored
2) Training dataset is imported from NLTK and preprocessed
3) Model is trained and tested on training set
4) Saved model is run on the tweets which we got from Twitter
